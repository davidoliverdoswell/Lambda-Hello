Hi, I'm David Doswell!

// List three words that describe you.

Thoughtful. Driven. Compassionate.

// Write a few sentences or a paragraph about your favorite hobby, your
favorite animal, or another personal favorite suitable for sharing on a public site.

Favorite hobby? Coding is up there. I often do that for fun. I am a self-taught (mostly rubbish but learning!) iOS developer.

I really enjoy writing. I wrote books of poetry when I was a kid and published a book of philosophical essays at 27. I also like cooking (I'm vegan, but no joke in the kitchen), running, reading weird stuff (white papers, Iain Banks, Gwern, Less Wrong, Norton Anthology of English Poetry), meeting interesting people, and thinking hard about how to improve the lives of my family and friends.

Favorite animal: saluki (dog).

Push further by practicing the way you amend an existing commit.

So, a bit of a struggle, here-- I never learned a uniform way to use Github (or Git, for that matter.) I am used to working alone, and have never used `git checkout` actually, and switched between Atom, GUI, and Terminal.

Hoping to learn more as a student here. As you also may have noticed, I am still learning how to follow directions. God help us.
